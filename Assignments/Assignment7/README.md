### Assignment 7 (due October 29)
1. Read the first part of [Python Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/#python) written by Justin Johnson. 
2. Take Quiz 6 on Blackboard.
3. Create a Jupyter notebook. Write a Python code snippet in a code cell for each of the following problems. Use Markdown cells and comments to add necessary notes and text.  
	1. Write a function to compute the mean, (sample) variance and (sample) standard deviation of a list of floating-point numbers passed to the function. The function returns a dictionary that maps a set of keys to the above descriptive statistic values. 
	2. Write a function to compute the mean of a series of numbers entered by the user. The user is allowed to input as many numbers as she/he wants. After the user enters "stop" instead of a number, the function computes and returns the mean value.

4. Create folder `hw7` within your local repo. Copy the Jupyter notebook you created above and the associated `.ipynb_checkpoints` folder to the `hw7` folder. Then upload the `hw7` folder to your remote repo. Finally, email the URL of your remote repo to the instructor before the class on October 29.
