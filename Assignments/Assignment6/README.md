### Assignment 6 (due October 22)
1. Read the following topics in [Python 3 Tutorial](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php)
  -  Formatted output with string modulo and the format method
  -  Functions
  -  Parameter Passing in Functions
  -  Namespaces
  -  Lambda Operator  
  -  Exception Handling
2. Take Quiz 5 on Blackboard.
3. Create a Jupyter notebook. Write a Python code snippet in a code cell for each of the following problems. Use Markdown cells and comments to add necessary notes and text. When you declare (define) a function, do not forget adding a docstring and indenting both the docstring and source code. You may refer to `fib.py` in folder `Chapter 2` for function declarations. 
	1. Write a function `freq` to count occurrences of each distinct character in a given string. The string is passed to the function as an argument. The function returns a dictionary with each character being the key of an item, and its frequency being the value of the item.
	2. Write a function `min_and_max` to find the minimum and maximum of a list. The list is passed to the function as an argument. The function returns both the minimum and maximum. Your function should work with lists of integers/floats as well as lists of strings.
	3. Write a function `cum_sum` to compute the cumulative sum of a list. For instance, the cumulative sum of a list `[1, 5, 2, 6]` is defined as `[1, 6, 8, 14]`. Your function should work with lists of integers/floats as well as lists of strings.
	4. Write a function `dot` that takes two lists of equal length as arguments, and returns the inner product of the two lists. For instance, the inner product of two lists [1, 5, 2, 6] and [0, 2, 3, 1] is evaluated as (1)(0)+(5)(2)+(2)(3)+(6)(1) = 22. 

4. Call each function declared above at least once, and include the necessary output in the Jupyter notebook. 
5. Create folder `hw6` within your local repo. Copy the Jupyter notebook you created above and the associated `.ipynb_checkpoints` folder to the `hw6` folder. Then upload the `hw6` folder to your remote repo. Finally, email the URL of your remote repo to the instructor before the class on October 22. 
6. (Due October 29) Download files `Miete.ipynb` and `Miete.csv` in the current folder to your computer. (To download an individual file from GitHub, click the file to view its contents, right-click the `Raw` button and select `Save link as...`). Follow the instructions in `Miete.ipynb` to analyze the `Miete` data set. After you finish programming, copy `Miete.ipynb` and the associated `.ipynb_checkpoints` folder to the `hw6` folder. Then upload the `hw6` folder to your remote repo. Finally, email the URL of your remote repo to the instructor before the class on October 29.
